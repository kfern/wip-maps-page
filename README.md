# Unit testing for https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform

Unit tests are a "legacy todo".

I'm going to use the [Maps page](https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform/tree/master/src/pages/Maps) as a proof of concept for a new unit tested version.

It's a Work In Progress & Request For Comments because this aproach requires a lot of refactoring.

I'm not solving every use cases but It can be a starting point.

It is a temporary repository. Feel free to "break it"
